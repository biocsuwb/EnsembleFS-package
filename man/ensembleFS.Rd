\arguments{
\item{x}{input data where columns are variables and rows are observations (all numeric)}

\item{y}{decision variable as a boolean vector of length equal to number of observations}

\item{methods}{A \code{\link{vector}}  with feature selection methods available in this library for comparison}

\item{method.cv}{validation method \code{kfoldcv} for cross-validation \code{k-fold} or \code{rsampling} for \code{random sampling}}

\item{params.cv}{A \code{\link{list}} with the following fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{k} --  the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into, not less than 3
\item \code{test.size} -- testing set size for random sampling validation
\item \code{iter} -- the number of validation repetitions
}}

\item{level.cor}{cutoff level of correlated variables. If equal to 1 is not performed}

\item{params}{A \code{\link{list}} with the following fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{adjust} -- method as accepted by \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}} (\code{"BY"} is recommended for FDR, see Details) for MDFS1D, MDFS2D and U-test
\item \code{feature.number} -- number of attributes to select. Must not exceed \code{ncol(x)}
\item \code{alpha} -- significance level for MDFS1D, MDFS2D and U-test
\item \code{use.cuda} -- whether to use CUDA acceleration (must be compiled with CUDA) for MDFS2D method
\item \code{cutoff.method} -- cutoff method MCFS: "permutations", "criticalAngle", "kmeans", "mean", "contrast"
}}

\item{asm}{A \code{\link{vector}} with enumeration method for which to calculate Lustgartenâ€™s stability measure}

\item{model}{A \code{\link{vector}} with enumeration method for which to training and testing model \code{RandomForest}}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{selected.feature} -- A \code{\link{list}} with the result of feature selection for the selected feature selection method
\item \code{ranking.feature} -- A \code{\link{list}} with the result of the rating of the variables that were most often performed in each iteration of cross-validation
\item \code{stability} -- A \code{\link{data.frame}} with the result of stability of selection of feature for the selected selection method
\item \code{model} -- A \code{\link{data.frame}} with the result of constructing a random forest model for the selected feature selection method
